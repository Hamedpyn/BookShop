# Book Shop

This is a responsive online Book Shop application built with React. The app allows users to browse, view, and manage books in a virtual shopping basket, with persistent data using local storage. The key features include:

## Features

- **Books Page**: Displays all available books with an "Add to Basket" button for easy selection.
- **Book Details**: Click on a book to navigate to its dedicated page, showing detailed information.
- **Basket Management**: A dedicated basket page lists all selected books, allowing users to adjust quantities or remove items entirely.
- **Persistent Data**: Books added to the basket are stored in local storage, so selections persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across different screen sizes for an optimized user experience on all devices.

This project demonstrates effective use of React with state management and local storage to create a seamless and engaging e-commerce experience.
